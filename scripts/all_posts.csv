<p><em><strong>*Next Saturday, October 6th, we will host a nutrition seminar starting at 11:00am.  This is free for our members but you are welcome to invite friends.  Non members will only pay $25.  This should last about an hour and a half.  This will be the same, individual specific guidelines Daniel has successfully used with numerous personal training clients as well as CrossFit members through the years.  There will be no advocating of crazy fad diets, or of the latest miracle supplement (that doesnt exist).  Just useful, well established information for individuals to change their eating habits in order to gain muscle, lose bodyfat and recover from intense workouts.  All while allowing room for eating the foods you crave from time to time!</strong></em></p>"

<p><strong>MOVEMENT STANDARDS</strong></p>
<p>DUMBBELL SNATCHES</p>
<p>The dumbbell snatch starts with the dumbbell on the ground and nishes with the dumbbell directly overhead. At the bottom of the movement, BOTH heads of the dumbbell must touch the ground. The dumbbell must be lifted overhead in one motion. Touch-and-go is permitted. Bouncing the dumbbell is not allowed. Athletes must alternate arms after each repetition and may not alternate until a successful rep is achieved. The non-lifting hand and arm may not be in contact with the body during the repetition.</p>
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 2"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<p>At the top, the arms, hips, and knees must be fully locked out with the dumbbell clearly over the middle of the athlete’s body when viewed from pro le. Once the athlete has reached lockout, the repetition will count. The athlete may choose to do a split style snatch. However, both feet must return and be in line under the athlete’s body while the dumbbell is locked out overhead for the repetition to count.</p>

<p>BURPEE BOX JUMP-OVER</p>
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 3"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<p>The burpee box jump-over starts with the athlete facing the box while touching their chest and thighs to the ground, and nishes with the athlete jumping over the box. In the bottom position, to ensure the athlete remains perpen- dicular to the box on each rep, the center of the athlete’s chest must be on the line, and the feet and hands must be straddling the line.</p>
</div>
<div class=""column"">
<p>There is no requirement to stand tall while on top of the box. A two-foot takeo is always required, and only the athlete’s feet may touch the box. The athlete may jump on top of the box using a two-foot landing and then jump or step o to the other side, or the athlete may jump completely over the box. If jumping over the box, the feet must go over the box, not around it, and the athlete must use a two-foot landing.</p>
</div>
<div class=""column"">
<p>Each rep is counted when the athlete lands on the ground on the opposite side, where they may begin their next rep.</p>

8 chest-to-bar pull-ups</p>
<p>Men lunge 95 lb.<br />
Women lunge 65 lb.</p>
<p><em>Notes</em><br />
<em>Prior to starting this workout, each athlete will need to mark a starting point on the floor, measure out 25 feet and make another mark on the floor at the finishing point. Additionally, intermediate marks must be made at every 5-foot interval, each of which represents 1 rep of the lunge.</em></p>
<p><em>This workout begins with the barbell resting on the floor near the pull-up bar. At the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will pick up the barbell and lunge with it overhead for 25 feet. They will then perform 8 burpees, jumping over the barbell on each repetition, before picking the barbell back up and lunging back in the opposite direction. Once back at the pull-up bar, they will perform 8 chest-to-bar pull-ups, and then will head back to the barbell to begin the next round.</em></p>
<p><em>Your score will be the total number of repetitions completed before the 20-minute time cap.</em></p>

In memory of Navy Lieutenant Michael Murphy, 29, of Patchogue, NY, who was killed in Afghanistan June 28th, 2005.<br />
This workout was one of Mike’s favorites and he’d named it ‘Body Armor.’ From here on it will be referred to as ‘Murph’ in honor of the focused warrior and great American who wanted nothing more in life than to serve this great country and the beautiful people who make it what it is.</p>

America&#8217;s values. In our darkest hour we surged through to the light on the<br />
backs of the military and patriotic people across the nation.<br />
On September 11 2011 we mark the ten-year anniversary of the attacks on America. In order to<br />
honor the sacrifice of those who lost their lives on that horrific day as well<br />
as the War on Terror we are asking everyone to come together and complete this epic WOD with us.</p>"

<p>Join us at the Ville on Sat. Sept 3rd for a WOD to honor the 31 heroes killed on August 6th in Afghanistan. The 31 Heroes WOD is super tough and is done with a partner. These Special Operations Warriors were enroute to aid a team in trouble, this is why it is a partner WOD. These warriors have made the ultimate sacrifice for our sake. We can all agree that no workout will ever be enough to say thank you, but among this community it almost seems to be our version of the “moment of silence”, a small way we can honor the those that have gone before us. We hope you’ll join us for this moment of silence. The workout is as follows&#8230;(remember it can be scaled).</p>
<p><strong>“31Heroes”</strong><br />
AMRAP 31 Min (As Many Reps As Possible)<br />
8 Thrusters (155/105)<br />
6 Rope Climbs (15 ft. ascent)<br />

<p><strong>This is a Partner WOD</strong> – Partner #1 will perform the work listed above. Partner #2 will run 400m with a sandbag (45/25). Once Partner #2 returns from the run, Partner #1 will grab the sandbag and begin their 400m, while Partner #2 continues work wherever #1 left off.</p>"

<p>&#8220;SATURDAY CRUSADE WOD&#8221;</p>
<div>A little over 6 years ago my wife and I weathered the most challenging time in our life we when lost our baby boy to genetic abnormalities prior to his birth.  That event motivated me to write a WOD dedicated to our loss.  On Saturday, June 4th, we&#8217;ll be performing this WOD.  We are asking that our athletes come to Crossfit The Ville and perform the WOD.  We will be collecting donations for the WHAS Crusade for Children.  There will be no charge for the WOD, just donations.  100% of all donations to the Crusade benefit children with special needs.  We&#8217;re looking forward to bringing the Crossfit The Ville and Crossfit Louisville East community together for a great cause and a great challenge.  WOD&#8217;s from 8:00 to 12:00 on the half hour.</div>

<p><strong>Thought of the week : Skinny Fat</strong></p>
<div>
<div> </div>
<p>Disclaimer: I have been getting a ton of questions about this topic from both inside and outside the gym, from lots of different people, so this isn’t directed at anyone in particular.  Although, if this topic resonates with you, take the time to read it.  This post is more a psychological and analytical approach to body image, Sean has the scientific approach in the comments.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things to fight as a coach is the thought that “Lifting weights is going to make me ‘bulk up’” from women.  My first response is to shake my head and contemplate shoving my hand in a toaster to cure the frustration… Yet, when I stop and think about it, I honestly like the way CrossFit makes my body look.  And I know there are many of us in the gym that wouldn’t be as enamored with CrossFit if we didn’t see aesthetic results in combination with fitness results, so I do think it is a valuable question that needs to be answered.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is look around the gym at girls that have been CrossFitting for a long time. If we created “bulky bodies”, you would see them at CFSB.  All the above are CrossFitters that have been with us a long time… Strong, not bulky, don’t you agree?? (Sorry for not including all our awesome girls, but I only went back three pages on flickr).</p>
<p><strong>Definitions and Misconceptions:</strong></p>
<p>To begin, we need to address some misconceptions about how the body works…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You cannot “tone” a certain portion of your body</strong>.  Your body will not lose fat in one spot at a time, it will only lose fat.  Thus, you must reduce your overall body fat percentage to see results in the area you want.  This is why the “ab-(insert attention-grabbing verb)” you see on TV won’t work to help you get a better midsection.</li>
<li>Lean – having little to no surplus fat &#8211; Thus, to look “lean”, you need to have low levels of body fat.</li>
<li>Toned – seeing muscle definition on a human body &#8211; Thus, to look “toned”, you need to have low levels of body fat combined with having enough muscular development that you can see the shape of the muscle under the skin.  This is usually accomplished at below 20% body fat on women, and below 10% on men.</li>
<li>You will never “bulk up” overnight, except from maybe an ice cream and beer binge (guilty).  You will never wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and realize that you just built bulky muscles in your sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>First, I want to establish that having muscle doesn’t mean being bulky…</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is compare these two women:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/runway-model.jpg"" rel=""lightbox[10409]""><img alt="""" height=""380"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/runway-model.jpg"" title=""runway model"" width=""256"" /></a><img alt="""" height=""380"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Crystal-682x1024.jpg"" title=""Crystal"" width=""243"" /></p>
<p>For reference, the girl on the left is a runway model and the girl on the right is an elite CrossFit athlete.  Both have approximately 12-15% body fat.  Both are doing something they love, and the bodies they have created help them do that.</p>
<p>On the left, we have a runway model who has almost zero muscular development while also having almost zero fat deposits.  She has enough essential muscle to not fall over walking, but not much more.  If you want to look like the woman on the left, sorry, but we cannot help you get there.  Although, if you have an apple and a cigarette a day for about a year, you could get close.  It supposedly worked for Christian Bale in the Machinist.  However, CrossFit South Bay will not help you create that type of body.</p>
<p>The female on the right has spent years developing her strength and muscle.  She has battled heavy weights and pushed herself to the limit to squat, deadlift, and lunge heavier weights every time she comes into the gym.  She weighs approximately 35-40 lbs more than the runway model due to the large amount of muscle that she has acquired.  She is likely approaching her genetic limits in the amount of muscle she can develop without going on a bodybuilding routine.  Between her and the runway model, there is likely <em><strong>very little difference</strong></em> genetically, yet there is a huge difference in training and diet (more on this shortly).</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dressed-up.jpeg"" rel=""lightbox[10409]""><img alt="""" height=""274"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dressed-up-300x274.jpg"" title=""dressed up"" width=""300"" /></a>Same elite CrossFitter, now dressed up, still bulky??</p>
<p>Thus, you can have a large amount of muscle without ever looking “bulky”.  Don’t you agree??</p>
<p><strong>Now that we know that muscle doesn’t make you “bulky”, what does??</strong></p>
<p>Well, the answer is fat.  Excess adipose tissue will result in less than satisfactory aesthetics.  This is regardless of the amount of muscle you have.  This is easily seen in the image below:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Skinny-Fat1.jpg"" rel=""lightbox[10409]""><img alt="""" height=""378"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Skinny-Fat1.jpg"" title=""Skinny Fat"" width=""252"" /></a></p>
<p>The image at left shows a female figure that has a large amount of fat, while having a very small amount of muscle.  This is described in the fitness community as “skinny fat”.  While not overly “bulky” she  doesn’t have the aesthetics that most of us work so hard to attain.  The woman in this image is likely at a level close to 30% body fat and likely has a similar amount of muscle as the runway model.  So even though she may look fine wearing a sweater, it is a different story at the beach.</p>
<p>The trick is how to fix this.  Well, option 1 is to eat less and do tons of cardio, surviving on a diet heavy with running and light on food, and you will end up looking more like the runway model above.  Option 2 is to develop muscle to burn away the excess fat while doing cardio, resulting in looking more like the elite CrossFitter above.</p>
<p>Ok, so we have started to establish that building muscle isn’t a bad thing, right??  Yet, you are afraid that by squatting and deadlifting, you are making your legs and butt bigger, thus getting more “bulky”, correct??</p>
<p>Here is the kicker, the reason your legs (and shoulders and arms and back) are getting a little bigger is that you have now started to add some muscle to them.  Now, that muscle will burn more calories, starting to help whittle away at the amount of fat you have on your body, even while you sleep.  You now are able to achieve that “lean” and “toned” look, as your body fat levels have decreased, and your muscle is starting to show, giving the “toned” look.</p>

<p>Some people keep saying to be leaner they just need more cardio and less strength.  Well, yes, if you just do “more cardio”, you will lose more fat, but you would also lose muscle because without strength training, your body burns muscle as well as fat.  So, instead of looking more like a Victoria Secret model, you start to look more like a runway model.  Then, once you stop doing “more cardio” you will gain fat even faster now that you don’t have the muscle to burn the extra calories, resulting in the “skinny fat” look.  You can see this in ex-athletes that have tried to “get leaner” by doing “more cardio” only to result in having more fat with less muscle.</p>

<p>Skinny</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>Strong</p>
<p>This can also happens as we age, as the muscle we built by running, jumping, and playing in our childhood and teens atrophies due to under-use with a more sedentary life, so people in their early twenties are seen as having “high metabolisms”, supposedly not having to work to maintain lean body shapes.  This “high metabolism” is because the muscle they built in their teen years is burning excess calories and fat, and with the low body fat levels, you can see their “toned” muscle underneath.  However, as they take day jobs and do not stimulate their bodies, their muscles atrophy, burning less calories and thereby lowering their “high metabolism” and leading to increased body fat as they age.  Usually, people try to do “more cardio” to regain their lean, toned bodies that they had when they were younger.  However, since they do nothing to build new muscle or maintain their current muscle, they slowly transition to a thin, but “skinny fat”, look as they age.</p>

<p><strong>Train like an athlete…. Look like an athlete…</strong></p>
<p>Most people can agree that they want to get “toned” and “lean”, but have you ever asked someone that was “toned” and “lean” what they have done to get that way??  You should, because almost every athlete I know that looks “toned” and “lean” has spent years working to develop strength, power, speed, endurance, and stamina for a sport.  They move HEAVY weights quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, you will never be able to create muscles like a man lifting weights.</strong></p>
<p>A WOMEN THAT LOOKS LIKE SHE HAS MUSCLES LIKE A MAN HAS LIKELY TAKEN STEROIDS!!  This is the defined truth, a woman’s muscle development is much different than a man’s.  Unless a woman has a very different genetic make-up (a very, very small portion of the population), or does bodybuilding type workouts, specifically designed to increase the size of the muscles, it is almost impossible to build muscle like a man.  (And, as much as you might think it is true, you only have a 1 in a million chance of being the 1 in a million that has the different genetics, so stop saying, and believing, it)</p>
<p>This is because males have 20-30 times the testosterone of women, resulting in deeper voices, more body hair, and more muscle development.  Women just physically cannot build muscle like men can, sorry but it is a scientific fact.  Some of the maximal amounts of muscle you can put on a female frame with CrossFit training can be seen below.  These are women that built their bodies using sports and strength training.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jessica-sharratt.jpg"" rel=""lightbox[10409]""><img alt="""" height=""300"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jessica-sharratt-200x300.jpg"" title=""jessica sharratt"" width=""200"" /></a><a href=""http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lauren-plumey.jpg"" rel=""lightbox[10409]""><img alt="""" height=""300"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lauren-plumey-199x300.jpg"" title=""lauren-plumey"" width=""199"" /></a><a href=""http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/athlete-miranda-oldroyd.jpg"" rel=""lightbox[10409]""><img alt="""" height=""300"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/athlete-miranda-oldroyd-157x300.jpg"" title=""athlete-miranda-oldroyd"" width=""157"" /></a></p>
<p>An extremely high level of muscle on a female will look like the pictures above, but again, only with many YEARS of weights training and a focus on a clean diet.</p>
<p>So, lastly, just to clarify, “bulky” means fat.  Which does not happen when you work hard at CrossFit South Bay!!</p>

3935,https://crossfittheville.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/why-deadlift/,&#8220;WHY DEADLIFT?&#8221;,2011-03-10T12:54:06Z,"<p><strong><span style=""font-size: large;""><a href=""https://crossfittheville.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/imagescavn8k2y.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-117"" src=""https://crossfittheville.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/imagescavn8k2y.jpg?w=615"" title=""imagesCAVN8K2Y"" /></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: large;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: large;"">Why Deadlift?<br />
<img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/i2.gif"" /></span></strong></p>
<p>As mentioned, the benefits of deadlifting are many and varied. If you have not added it to your program yet, you probably will after learning of its amazing qualities. Indeed, deadlifting is advantageous because:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Minimum Equipment</strong></span></p>
<ul>It requires little in the way of equipment and preparation. A bar and the willingness to lift it are the only real requirements for a successful deadlift. Wraps are optional, and in many cases, not required.</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Core Stability</strong></span></p>
<ul>It builds core stability. The deadlift directly targets all of the major muscle groups responsible for correct posture and core strength. Correct deadlifting technique enables one to hold their back straight when engaging in daily activities, due to its emphasis on maintaining a straight back throughout its movement.The deadlift will also strengthen all the surrounding supporting muscles of the waist, backside, hips and, of course, lower back. Core strength is important in terms of maintaining ones balance, and weight transference (whether in sport or daily life).</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>More Muscles Worked</strong></span></p>
<ul>As mentioned, it works more muscles simultaneously than any other movement (yes, including even the beloved squat). The many muscles the deadlift targets will be discussed in the next section. The deadlift truly forces the whole body to grow.</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Safety</strong></span></p>
<ul>It is relatively risk free and safe to perform. With the deadlift, there is no risk of getting pinned under a maximum lift (as with the squat and bench press), and provided form is correct, will not unduly stress any of the major joints.</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Real Life Application</strong></span></p>
<ul>It has a real life application. Lifting objects from the ground, from a variety of angles, is enhanced through regular deadlifting. The real life functionality of the deadlift comes into play when one becomes strong enough to lift a heavy object (furniture for example), while decreasing the likelihood of injuring themselves.</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Gripping Strength</strong></span></p>
<ul>It develops gripping strength. If done without wraps, the deadlift will strengthen the grip like no other movement due to the sheer weight involved (it is not uncommon for one to work up to 300+ pounds for repetitions).</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>True Measure Of Strength</strong></span></p>
<ul>It could be argued that, in a powerlifting context, the deadlift is a true measure of strength due to its lack of emphasis on various performance aids (suits etc). It also employs more muscle groups, and therefore could be deemed a better test of overall muscle strength.</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Special Appeal</strong></span></p>
<ul>It has a special appeal. Simply picking a weight off the floor, and engaging all major muscle groups in the process, has a special primordial appeal &#8211; sort of like ripping a gigantic tree out of the ground. Standing and holding the massive weight also promotes a feeling of immense power</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ar.jpg"" /> <span style=""font-family: arial; color: #d2df06; font-size: small;""><strong>Cardio Respiratory Fitness</strong></span></p>
<ul>It helps to develop cardio respiratory fitness. Like the squat, deadlifts will severely tax the cardio respiratory system if done with enough intensity. This obviously has positive ramifications for cardiovascular health. In fact, high intensity deadlifts aerobically tax the body big time.</ul>"

<div><a name=""2454768860253433835""></a>CrossFit vs. P90X</p>
<div>This blog was found on CrossFit Surf City in Huntington Beach.</p>
<p>The next time somebody tries to tell you that their P90X DVD is harder than CrossFit refer them to this article. This is courtesy of Full Potential Fitness and sums up some of the flaws in the P90X program.&#8221;P90X. It seems only fitting that I write my opinions on this program since everyone seems to be asking me. It has taken me a while to formulate my thoughts but keep in mind that I have yet to devote 90 days to this program and nor do I intend to.</p>
<p>From the looks of the website as well as the infomercials the whole concept of P90X is that they utilize the “revolutionary” and “advanced training technique” called Muscle Confusion. Basically, you never give your body the same workout so that your muscles are constantly “guessing” and having to adapt. Since the adaptation process of training is what creates the spike in metabolism it would seem like this program would work right? Correct. I have seen people do P90X with decent results and I’ve seen people do P90X with poor result. The difference? THE DIET. Those who followed a clean diet found better results. What does this mean? It means what every strength and conditioning coach will tell you, “You can’t train a crappy diet.” I don’t care how many air squats you do in 20 minutes time, if you are eating fried chicken on the daily you will remain fat….or get fatter for that matter.</p>
<p>I will say that I have a few gripes with P90X though. Here they are…</p>
<p>1. “Muscle Confusion” IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT. It is one of the AGE-OLD principles of a proper training program. I don’t care if you’re a strength athlete, a sports athlete, or just a gym rat…giving your body new stimuli to adapt to goes back to the CORE BASICS of training. It’s not revolutionary or cutting-edge (although I understand that P90X is just trying to make a buck so they market it as something new that they supposedly came up with). The principle is actually called the GAS principle. General Adaptation Syndrome. Look it up. It’s been around. Oh yeah, and it’s pretty much the model that CrossFit follows. Just look at my WODs for the proof.</p>
<p>2. Programming – P90X claims that it’s about all around fitness. It says that it’s about transforming your whole body, yet many of the DVD’s are centered around body-part splits….and ooollllldddd-school body part splits at that. I mean, who in their right mind still spends an hour doing a “Chest, Shoulders, and Triceps” workout? I mean c’mon, I think drinking a shot of Tabasco sauce would be more exciting. I do understand and appreciate them factoring workouts like Yoga X and X Stretch either as a means of recovery workout or as a way to instill flexibility and quality tissue, but I wish they would encourage this as a piece to each workout and not make it a complete workout all on its own.</p>
<p>3. Intensity – Following this program greatly lacks in accountability on a number of levels. First, you’re allowed to pause the dvd. Now, I know all people start at different levels of fitness and so some people need more rest than others, but I guarantee you that most people are still going to get too much rest. Rather than encouraging “rest as needed” principles, I’d rather scale down the workout to allow people to maintain the same high-intensity total output I’m looking for. Second, this DVD doesn’t know if you’re even doing your exercises properly! I understand that not everyone can afford a trainer or a coach, but if you aren’t going to do your bodyweight squats below parallel with a strongly arched lower back like you’re supposed to, you’re not doing enough work. I don’t care if this means you can get more reps in less time. Third, there’s no progression in strength. I know P90X claims to get your stronger, and I don’t argue that it does (I know people who can do pullups now because of P90X…but I know people who can do more than them because of Crossfit. Go figure). Unless you’re willing to constantly buy more dumbbells, you’re not going to get stronger. Strength improvements can be seen in at least 6 weeks. That’s 42 days. Last time I checked the DVD was called P90X, not P42. That means after your strength has gone up if you aren’t constantly pushing heavier loads, you’re just getting weaker. Also, if you can’t get your hands on a barbell to do some deadlifts and a bar on your back for some heavy squats, you’re not getting stronger. And ladies, I know you’re going to say, “I don’t want to get bulky.” Unless you are an Eastern European powerlifter on the juice, that won’t happen so quit worrying.</p>
<p>To its credit though P90X DOES get people exercising and it’s a lot better than someone taking the pages out of a bodybuilding magazine and mindlessly busting out bicep curls and lateral raises.</p>

<p>Why is it that, although the human species is pretty pathetic when it comes to sprinting (just imagine Usain Bolt matching up with your average cheetah in an Olympic 100-meter final and you get the picture), we really rock as long-distance runners? In a long-enough distance race, a well-trained human can outrun just about any species on the planet. Did we evolve to run long distances? There is certainly some compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. Daniel Lieberman, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard University, and Dennis Bramble, a biologist at the University of Utah, argue that many of the morphological and physiological characteristics of humans make us uniquely adapted to running long distances. But if so, why are those of us who run for recreation or competition so prone to running-related injuries? If we are natural runners, shouldn&#8217;t running come naturally to us? Nowadays, we have a plethora of fancy cushioned running shoe designs supposedly intended to alleviate all manner of running related ailments. Maybe you need a stability shoe for added support or perhaps a motion control shoe in order to avoid excessive pronation. It may seem logical that cushioning reduces the impact forces experienced while running but do they really? In fact although it seems counter intuitive there may be evidence to the contrary! At the same time there is no convincing evidence supporting the case that cushioned running shoes actually do anything to reduce the rate of running injury. All of these issues are addressed in a fascinating new book published last week by journalist and ultra-marathon runner Christopher McDougall, entitled Born to Run. Being both a runner and a science professional, I couldn&#8217;t put the book down. In Born to Run McDougall sets out on &#8220;an epic adventure that all began with one simple question &#8212; why does my foot hurt?&#8221; Inside, we follow the story of McDougall&#8217;s attempt to answer that question. His search ultimately culminates in an underground fifty-mile trail race. Among the contestants are the author, a handful of world-class ultramarathon champions, a barefoot-running guru, an enigmatic loner, and the legendary Tarahumara Indians of Mexico&#8217;s Copper Canyon. The Tarahumara are famous for being able to run incredible distances (up to hundreds of miles) in homemade sandals, and are seemingly immune to the multiple running injuries that plague the rest of us. McDougall also weaves in a fair amount of scientific research pertaining to running form, running shoes, and running injuries, ultimately leading us to question what in fact is the most natural way for us to run. As you can see in the video above, Chris runs with short, quick strides. His feet land under his center of gravity, beneath his hips, and he strikes the ground towards the front part of his foot. While he does not seem to have the slight forward lean that we see in elite distance runners, he does look pretty light on his feet for such a big fellow. In Born to Run, we learn that this was not always the case. Previously a chronically injured backward-leaning heel-striker, Chris attributes his new efficient stride and lack of recent injury to his conversion to the barefoot school of running. (Those huarache sandals still count as barefoot running in that they don&#8217;t provide any padding &#8212; just a tougher skin on the bottom of the foot so to speak. It&#8217;s the same with the Vibram Five Fingers Chris is pulling out at the end of the video &#8212; a minimalist second skin to keep out stray shards of glass, thorny thistles, and the like.) As a follow-up to my own recent posts on the science of running, I spoke with McDougall over the phone. After speaking with McDougall, at least one thing is clear to me: there really hasn&#8217;t been a sufficiently thorough controlled scientific study to address this thought-provoking issue. Are most shoes actually doing more harm than good? Is it possible to design a shoe that allows for a natural barefoot-like gait, or is genuine barefoot running truly the best thing for your feet? Over the past couple of weeks, I have done a little bit of (non-systematic) personal experimenting, running barefoot on grass and removing orthotics from my shoes during several of my weekly runs. Too early to draw any subjective conclusions! Is it really true that overuse injuries are nonexistent among the Tarahumara? As far as can be measured, yes. We see Tarahumara running into their 80s and 90s. The only running-related injuries they seem to get are things like broken legs due to falling. [note: the Copper Canyons in Mexico are known to be incredibly treacherous and rugged, with vertiginously steep, rocky terrain.</p>

<p>Since obesity rates can be an indicator of a nation’s nutritional trends, health and culture, we thought it might be useful information for the expat to know. Here are the 10 fattest countries of the last decade:</p>
<h4>(1) American Samoa, 93.5% (of the population that is overweight)</h4>
<p>It’s a staggering number. Many Pacific Island nations have had trouble with weight in modern times mostly because they have abandoned their traditional foods for cheap, easily attained processed foods from the West. Perhaps no other Pacific Island has had such access to these habits as American Samoa.</p>
<h4>(2) Kiribati, 81.5%</h4>
<p>Like American Samoa, Kiribati has been flooded with processed foods like Spam and mutton flaps (fatty sheep scraps), often sold at lower prices than native food.</p>
<h4>(3) U.S.A., 66.7%</h4>
<p>Well, the U.S.A. doesn’t top the list, but it’s close, and it falls behind only a small islands nation and one of its own unincorporated territories. The <a href=""http://www.expatify.com/united-states"" title=""United States"">United States</a> of Processed food, high fructose corn syrup and fast food has been high on this list over the last half century.</p>
<h4>(4) Germany, 66.5%</h4>
<p>The fattest country in Europe no doubt owes their portly woes to lots of beer, fatty foods and inactivity.</p>
<h4>(5) Egypt, 66%</h4>
<p>Obesity among Egyptian women is particularly high, often attributed to cultural taboos on women exercising or playing sports.</p>
<h4>(6) Bosnia-Herzegovina, 62.9%</h4>
<p>Once considered a problem only in high-income countries, obesity is dramatically on the rise in low- and middle-income countries like Bosnia-Herzegovina, where smoking, drinking and eating unhealthy foods spiked during the war that ravaged the country from 1992 to 1995.</p>
<h4>(7) New Zealand, 62.7%</h4>
<p>Obesity is a growing concern for <a href=""http://www.expatify.com/new-zealand"" title=""New Zealand"">New Zealand</a>. While its native Maori have struggled with weight due to loss of traditional culture like other Pacific Islanders– they are mostly just a scapegoat. New Zealand’s entire population is getting fatter at a rapidly increased rate.</p>
<h4>(8) Israel, 61.9%</h4>
<p>In the past 30 years, the number of obese Israelis has tripled, evidence the country is truly part of the Western world.</p>
<h4>(9) Croatia, 61.4%</h4>
<p>Croatia, where cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, is also a victim of the globalization of the food market, which tends to suppress traditional diets as cheaper processed foods from the U.S. and Europe flood store shelves.</p>
<h4>(10) United Kingdom, 61%</h4>
<p>A recent survey ranked Brits among the bottom third of European nations in physical exercise, leading Health Secretary Andy Burnham to comment, “We’re really in danger of being known as the best in the world for watching sport, but one of the worst for getting out there and doing it for ourselves.”</p>

<p>So as america is geting fatter and we don&#8217;t allow our kids to have P.E. or play dodge ball because it might hurt there feelings. I don&#8217;t know about you but if we keep heading on this path we won&#8217;t be lasting much longer as the top dog on the block, A recent study showed that 75% percent of our young 18-22 are unfit to join the military, WOW. Remember is the surrvail of the fittest not the fattest, And strong people are harder to kill.  Please send me your thoughts&#8230;..</p>"

<h2>Globo gym vs CrossFit gym</h2>
<div>
<p>I visited a Crossfit affiliate for the first time ever this weekend. Allow me to compare and contrast a first-time Crossfit visit vs. a first-time Globo gym visit. Globo first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter gym. Notice front desk employee sitting in front of a computer. Wait about 15-20 seconds for them to stop playing solitaire or Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Hi, I’m Brian. This is my first time here.” “Oh, let me get a “trainer” to show you around.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Walk through the gym. Trainer shows you the “cardio areas”, which consist of rows upon rows of treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Next, you are shown the “machines areas”. Various contraptions with diagrams that highlight whatever muscle group the thing is supposed to isolate. If you’re lucky, they’ll have Hammer Strength stuff!! You may get a line like “This machine is designed to work you exactly like free weights.” You think to yourself, “Hmmm, well why not just do free weights, then?” You also note that at least 2 of the four walls in every area are made up entirely of mirrors. And people are standing and looking at themselves in them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The tour continues: “Here we have the free weight area. You can use this if you want to get hyoooge.” This typically equates to the square footage of a walk-in closet. Work boots, little tank-tops, and multiple shakers full of <a href=""http://rehobothcrossfit.com/nutrition-diet-recipes/supplements/"" title=""supplements"">supplements</a> abound.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now, the all-important retreat into a tiny office where you get the used-car sale. Something like, “Well, typically our memberships are $59/mo, plus a $269 sign-up fee. We’ll waive the fee and set you up on a tiered payment plan where every year the fee will drop 11.59043% until you reach year 4, at which point…” blah blah blah. You counter with, “Well my friend pays $20/mo with no sign-up fee.” They respond, “I’ll have to get my manager.” The dance continues. You threaten to walk out. At this point, you may or may not get the “super secret pricing deal”. You realize you’ve lost a little bit of your soul. They throw in free tanning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You are now a member. You work out for 2 years. You see the same people every day. You never talk to them. After 2 years you notice that they all look exactly the same as the first day you ever saw them, despite the fact that they spend at least an hour a day on the elliptical while <a href=""http://rehobothcrossfit.com/library/"" title=""reading"">reading</a> a magazine or talking on their cell phones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OK, the Crossfit gym first-time experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you notice is that there really isn’t a front door – it’s a garage door. Or two. Did this place used to be an auto shop?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next thing you notice are people on the floor gasping for air. You can see this clearly as the whole place is one open room and the garage doors are open.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You walk in. At first, you’re not quite sure who works there and who works out there – they all look about the same. Eventually, a trainer or owner finds you and greets you enthusiastically.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You’re invited to take part in a workout. As you wait for the current group to finish up, you take notice of your surroundings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No air conditioning. No mirrors. Not a single treadmill. Rowers – uh oh.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ropes and gymnastics rings hanging from the ceiling. Kettlebells. Weight racks. Weird rubber weights. Lots and lots and lots of places to do pull-ups. Instead of mirrors, the walls are covered with dry-erase boards. And peoples names are listed under various workouts that have girls’ names as the titles. Obviously people compete over everything here. As people finish the workout and peel themselves off the floor, you notice that they all seem to be friends.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK, time for the workout. A trainer takes you and whoever else is there for a first-time visit and you do some stretches, and then they actually teach you how to do whatever you’re going to be doing that day. Real <a href=""http://rehobothcrossfit.com/media/videos/health/"" title=""instruction"">instruction</a> (with PVC pipe), and the guy (or girl) actually sounds like they know what they’re talking about.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Workout time. 3-2-1-go. 1 minute into the workout you realize that you actually might die before it’s done. You regret eating whatever it was you ate for breakfast, because you’re pretty sure everybody is going to see it coming out of your mouth. 7 minutes later you’re finished, and soaked with sweat on a pile on the floor. You think to yourself that you did more work in 7 minutes than most people at your old globo did in a month.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After the workout, you’re told you can hang around and ask questions or go home and ice yourself down. No pitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, which one sounds better? I’m pretty sure I have not exaggerated anything here – these are my actual experiences. I’m also joining the Crossfit gym.</p>
<p>Taken from CrossFit Rehoboth..So True so very true.</p>
<p>Do you have a story of your experience at a Globo Gym, Please share.</p>

<p>There are three main energy systems that fuel all human activity. Almost all changes that occur in the body due to exercise are related to the demands placed on these energy systems. Furthermore, the efficacy of any given fitness regimen may largely be tied to its ability to elicit an adequate stimulus for change within these three energy systems.</p>
<p>Energy is derived aerobically when oxygen is utilized to metabolize substrates derived from food and liberates energy. An activity is termed aerobic when the majority of energy needed is derived aerobically. These activities are usually greater than ninety seconds in duration and involve low to moderate power output or intensity. Examples of aerobic activity include running on the treadmill for twenty minutes, swimming a mile, and watching TV.</p>
<p>Energy is derived anaerobically when energy is liberated from substrates in the absence of oxygen. Activities are considered anaerobic when the majority of the energy needed is derived anaerobically. These activities are of less than two minutes in duration and involve moderate to high power output or intensity. There are two such anaerobic systems, the phosphagen system and the lactic acid system. Examples of anaerobic activity include running a 100-meter sprint, squatting, and doing pull-ups.</p>
<p>Our main purpose here is to discuss how anaerobic and aerobic training support performance variables like strength, power, speed, and endurance. We also support the contention that total conditioning and optimal health necessitates training each of the physiological systems in a systematic fashion.</p>
<p>It warrants mention that in any activity all three energy systems are utilized though one may dominate. The interplay of these systems can be complex, yet a simple examination of the characteristics of aerobic vs. anaerobic training can prove useful.</p>
<p>Aerobic training benefits cardiovascular function and decreases body fat. This is certainly of significant benefit. Aerobic conditioning allows us to engage in moderate/low power output for extended period of time. This is valuable for many sports. Athletes engaging in excessive aerobic training witness decreases in muscle mass, strength, speed, and power. It is not uncommon to find marathoners with a vertical leap of several inches and a bench press well below average for most athletes. Aerobic activity has a pronounced tendency to decrease anaerobic capacity. This does not bode well for athletes or the individual interested in total conditioning or optimal health.</p>
<p>Anaerobic activity also benefits cardiovascular function and decreases body fat. Anaerobic activity is unique in its capacity to dramatically improve power, speed, strength, and muscle mass. Anaerobic conditioning allows us to exert tremendous forces over a very brief time. Perhaps the aspect of anaerobic conditioning that bears greatest consideration is that anaerobic conditioning will not adversely affect aerobic capacity! In fact, properly structured, anaerobic activity can be used to develop a very high level of aerobic fitness without the muscle wasting consistent with high volume aerobic exercise!</p>
<p>Basketball, football, gymnastics, boxing, track and field events under one mile, soccer, swimming events under 400 yards, volleyball, wrestling, and weightlifting are all sports that require the majority of training time spent in anaerobic activity. Long distance and ultra-endurance running, cross-country skiing, and 1500+ yard swimming are all sports that require aerobic training at levels that produce results unacceptable to other athletes or individuals concerned with total conditioning or optimal health.</p>
<p>The CrossFit approach is to judiciously balance anaerobic and aerobic exercise in a manner that is consistent with the athlete’s goals. Our exercise prescriptions adhere to proper specificity, progression, variation, and recovery to optimize adaptations.</p>

<strong>The CrossFit dietary prescription is as follows:</strong><br />
<strong>Protein </strong>should be lean and varied and account for about 30% of your total caloric load.<br />
<strong>Carbohydrates </strong>should be predominantly low-glycemic and account for about 40% of your total caloric load.<br />
<strong>Fat </strong>should be predominantly monounsaturated and account for about 30% of your total caloric load.<br />
<strong>Calories </strong>should be set at between .7 and 1.0 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass depending on your activity level. The .7 figure is for moderate daily workout loads and the 1.0 figure is for the hardcore athlete.</p>
<p><strong>What Should I Eat?</strong><br />
In plain language, base your diet on garden vegetables, especially greens, lean meats, nuts and seeds, little starch, and no sugar. That&#8217;s about as simple as we can get. Many have observed that keeping your grocery cart to the perimeter of the grocery store while avoiding the aisles is a great way to protect your health. Food is perishable. The stuff with long shelf life is all suspect. If you follow these simple guidelines you will benefit from nearly all that can be achieved through nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>The Caveman or Paleolithic Model for Nutrition</strong><br />
Modern diets are ill suited for our genetic composition. Evolution has not kept pace with advances in agriculture and food processing resulting in a plague of health problems for modern man. Coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, obesity and psychological dysfunction have all been scientifically linked to a diet too high in refined or processed carbohydrate. Search &#8220;Google&#8221; for Paleolithic nutrition, or diet. The return is extensive, compelling, and fascinating. The Caveman model is perfectly consistent with the CrossFit prescription.</p>
<p><strong>What Foods Should I Avoid?</strong><br />
Excessive consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates is the primary culprit in nutritionally caused health problems. High glycemic carbohydrates are those that raise blood sugar too rapidly. They include rice, bread, candy, potato, sweets, sodas, and most processed carbohydrates. Processing can include bleaching, baking, grinding, and refining. Processing of carbohydrates greatly increases their glycemic index, a measure of their propensity to elevate blood sugar.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Problem with High-Glycemic Carbohydrates?</strong><br />
The problem with high-glycemic carbohydrates is that they give an inordinate insulin response. Insulin is an essential hormone for life, yet acute, chronic elevation of insulin leads to hyperinsulinism, which has been positively linked to obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, blood pressure, mood dysfunction and a Pandora&#8217;s box of disease and disability. Research &#8220;hyperinsulinism&#8221; on the Internet. There&#8217;s a gold mine of information pertinent to your health available there. The CrossFit prescription is a low-glycemic diet and consequently severely blunts the insulin response.</p>
<p><strong>Caloric Restriction and Longevity</strong><br />
Current research strongly supports the link between caloric restriction and an increased life expectancy. The incidence of cancers and heart disease sharply decline with a diet that is carefully limited in controlling caloric intake. “Caloric Restriction” is another fruitful area for Internet search. The CrossFit prescription is consistent with this research.<br />
The CrossFit prescription allows a reduced caloric intake and yet still provides ample nutrition for rigorous activity.</p>

<p>The 2011 season will start with the CrossFit Games Open on <a href=""http://games.crossfit.com/blog/2011/01/crossfit-games-open,1012/"">March 15th</a>. The Open is a six-week-long competition open to anyone in the world. There will be one workout per week, and athletes must <a href=""http://games.crossfit.com/blog/2011/02/team-and-affiliate-validation-information,1033/"">submit a validated performance</a>, either by uploading a video of the workout or by performing it at a Registered Affiliate.

<p>The new website will go live on March 7th, and will have all the rules, regulations, and registration options in full detail. The cost will be $10 in the US and Canada, $5 in the rest of the world. The Open will also screen the top athletes and <a href=""http://games.crossfit.com/blog/2011/02/team-and-affiliate-validation-information,1033/"">teams</a> for Regional Qualifiers, and Masters athletes directly for the Games.

<p>If you want to run correctly, take your shoes off. Head out for a short jog maybe 50-100 meters (make sure there is no broken glass or sharp objects to hurt your precious footsies). Does it hurt your heels, knees, hips, or back? If so, you are probably running incorrectly. From a young age we are taught to heel strike with every step. The running industry has made billions selling shoes designed to absorb the shock of heel strike running. Nike is full of air and Asics is gellin’, but your knees are still swellin’.<br />
When you run without shoes, heel strikes are very painful. Our heels have little to no natural cushion, and are not made to take the force of a blunt hit to the ground…much less recurring hits during a run or jog. If we can live through our heel pain, we will eventually notice pain moving up through our other joints. Think ankle, knee, hips and back. One or all of your joints have to absorb the shock you are inflicting with every step.<br />
From a physics standpoint, heel strike running doesn’t make sense either. Why would you try to increase the speed of a forward moving object by placing something in front of it? Try rolling a ball forward. Now place something in front of the ball. What happens? The ball stops. When we run incorrectly, landing with our heels in front of our bodies, we are momentarily putting on the brakes and slowing our forward momentum. We then have to push off again to regain speed.</p>
<p>So now what? When you run without shoes, you are forced to run on the balls of your feet. The balls of our feet are naturally padded, and our arches are designed to give and spring with each step. When you run, do so on the balls of your feet. Don’t get over zealous and run up on your toes. Allow your foot to land on the ground directly underneath your body. Make sure you hit between mid to fore foot and allow your heel to barely kiss the ground. Don’t think of pushing off with each step. Your goal is to leave your foot on the ground as little as possible. Concentrate on pulling your foot up and off the ground immediately. To clarify, run in place. Nobody pushes off the ground when you run in place. You pull, pull, pull. Now try pushing off with each step: I bet you look funny and feel even funnier. You want to pull your foot off the ground as you run.<br />
Your speed is depicted by the angle of your body leaning forward. You don’t want to fall on your face right? The lean is your entire body angle. Don’t lean forward from the hip. If you want to speed up, lean forward. If you want to slow down, keep a more up right angle.<br />
This technique is extremely helpful on tough up hill runs and painful, knee-biting down hill runs. It’s called the Pose method, and takes so much pain out of running.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning the correct running method let me know, I can put you on the right track in less then 3 hours</p>

3950,https://crossfittheville.wordpress.com/2011/02/22/why-do-you-crossfit/,Why do you CrossFit,2011-02-22T01:00:12Z,"<h3><a href=""https://crossfittheville.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/imagescaa4r7lr.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-50"" src=""https://crossfittheville.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/imagescaa4r7lr.jpg?w=615"" title=""imagesCAA4R7LR"" /></a></h3>
<h3>1.    Save time working out</h3>
<p>Why spend 1-2 hours at the gym, when you can get a great workout in less than 30 minutes.  Don’t get me wrong, not ALL of the workouts are that short, but a good portion of them are.</p>
<h3>2.    Get stronger physically AND mentally</h3>
<p>You will gain (or regain) strength to allow you to lift large loads over long distances quickly. Whether you’re moving a large 300lb TV or picking up a little child off the floor, you will become stronger. The workouts will also help you build mental fortitude. When you complete a once seemingly difficult workout, you get a sense of acomplishment that will help you conquer other obstacles in your life.</p>
<p>Yes, you can experience the full benefit of these two traits from most workout regimens.  However, with CrossFit you get a large support group that will help you throughout your progression.  The community is very tight knit and we all champion each other.  It’s very similar to “Team in Training” for distance runners.  The collaboriative support of each individual member is what makes the program such a success. This goes into my next point…</p>
<h3>3.    Make friends from all walks of life</h3>
<p>The CrossFit community is broad and inclusive. You may come across your local police officers, firefighters, and even your first grade teacher. CrossFit gyms are not like your local Globo Gyms where everyone is out there for themselves.  They training environments are much more quaint allowing you to build strong relationships full of integrity and comraderie.</p>
<h3>4.    CrossFit is safe</h3>
<p>Safety and efficiency are the most important and interdependent elements of any fitness program. In order for a fitness program to be 100% safe, it must be 100% ineffective (ie. 60 minutes of the elliptical). The intensity involved with CrossFit are only introduced once proper technique and mechanics are established.</p>
<h3>5.    Functional movements</h3>
<p>How long do you want to be able to get in and out of bed on your own? How about go to the bathroom on your own? If you’re like me, you answer is pretty much “As long as I’m alive!”. These are natural and essential movements that all humans should be able to do. These cannot be broken down into simple movements done on the leg extension or bicep curl machines.</p>
<h3>6.    Prepare for the Unknown &amp; Unknowable</h3>
<p>Who knows when you will need to save your own or your family’s life. In the unlikely event of a fire or natural disaster, don’t you want to be ready and able to do what you need to do? Call me crazy but often times I ask myself if I can outrun a cop if I were to break the law if I lived in an alternate reality.  The thing is, I probably can.</p>
<h3>7.    Never get bored</h3>
<p>Begone boring workout routines. Yeah, I admit it… I used to do the whole routine of back/biceps on Monday, chest/triceps on Wednesday, and legs/shoulders on Friday EVERY WEEK. I know some of you have too. You will never do what you did last week or even last month. The best way to stick to a fitness program is to keep it dynamic and interesting.  Because the CrossFit regimen follows an open source model, you’ll find adaptations and variations all the time that target whatever your focus is on that day.</p>

<p><strong> Go Outside.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If there’s one thing I’ve learned during this trans-national</strong></p>
<p><strong>adventure of mine, it’s that there is nothing like training out</strong></p>
<p><strong>in the open. Urban environment or rural environment, city</strong></p>
<p><strong>street or barren trail … get outside and train without walls.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some might argue that cities, by their very nature, don’t</strong></p>
<p><strong>lend themselves to physical exploration. They’re lazy. Some</strong></p>
<p><strong>say the countryside encourages accessibility, freedom of</strong></p>
<p><strong>movement and an exploratory eagerness that cities do</strong></p>
<p><strong>not. Maybe it’s not our environment that cultivates these</strong></p>
<p><strong>characteristics in us, but we who find them in it. There are</strong></p>
<p><strong>no objects in nature whose equivalent can’t be found in a</strong></p>
<p><strong>city if you’re looking with open eyes. Mountains are nature’s</strong></p>
<p><strong>staircases, and trees are her climbing walls. Carrying a bag</strong></p>
<p><strong>of cement is the same as shouldering a fallen limb, and</strong></p>
<p><strong>lifting a stone is, well, you get the picture.</strong></p>
