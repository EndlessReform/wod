Make Up Day.

**\*This Friday's 6pm class is cancelled so that we can set up for the
Granite Games Throwdown on Saturday.  If you can come out and help us
set up at 6pm we'd really appreciate it!**

**\*Saturday is our Granite Games Spring Throwdown!  If you aren't
competing come out and cheer on the teams!  First workout starts at
9:00am!**
