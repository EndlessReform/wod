Rest Day.

***\*True Grit 6 is coming September 15th.  We will accept late
registrations until Sept 8th but you will not get your shirts on the
15th.  If you'd like to compete but don't have a team we have a signup
sheet by the white board. You can also email us to get on a team. If
you'd like to help judge please add your name to the sheet.  We still
need several more judges.  ***
