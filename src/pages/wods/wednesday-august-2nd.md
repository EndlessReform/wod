members get together at the Barnett's house Sunday, August 6th, from
12-6. We'll eat, watch the Games, and swim if you'd like. This is a
family friendly event so bring the kids! Please bring a side dish (if
your last name starts with A-M) or dessert (if your last name starts
with N-Z). We'll supply the meat and drinks. Email, call or text Daniel
