***\*This Saturday, October 6th, we will host a nutrition seminar
starting at 11:00am.  This is free for our members but you are welcome
to invite friends.  Non members will only pay \$25.  This should last
about an hour and a half.  This will be the same, individual specific
guidelines Daniel has successfully used with numerous personal training
clients as well as CrossFit members throughout the years.  There will be
no advocating of crazy fad diets, or of the latest miracle supplement
(that doesn't exist).  Just useful, well established information for
individuals to change their eating habits in order to gain muscle, lose
bodyfat and recover from intense workouts.  All while allowing room for
eating the foods you crave from time to time!***
