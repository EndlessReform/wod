***\*Our Granite Games Winter Throwdown is December 7th here at The
Ville!  Another opportunity to earn a spot at the Granite Games
Championships next year.  The last day to register your team and get
your shirt on the day of the competition is November 13th so don't wait,
sign up today!  We're only taking 30 teams and we've sold out for both
Throwdowns so get your team registered!  ***

***\*We are in need for Judges/Volunteers for our Granite Games Winter
Throwdown on December 7th.  If you aren't competing please consider
helping out!  We'll get you a shirt (if you volunteer by Nov 3rd), and
feed you throughout the day.  Sign up on competition corner.net and be
sure to put in your shirt size.***
