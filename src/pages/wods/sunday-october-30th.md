Rest Day.

***\*There will be no 5:30 class this Monday at Louisville East so you
can go trick or treating!  There will be a 4:30 & 5:30 class at The
Ville on Monday but we will close directly after class so no open gym
from 6:30-8.***

***\*True Grit 4 is filled with teams ready to rumble for 1st place this
Saturday, November 5th! Come out and watch the action at The Ville
starting at 9:00am. <https://truegritcomp.wordpress.com>***

***\*There will be no 5:30pm class or open gym after 5:30 this Friday at
The Ville so that we can set up for True Grit.  If anyone is available
to help set up please show up at 5:30.***

***\*We are collecting blankets, scarves and gloves at Louisville East
and The Ville for the homeless this winter. If you'd like to donate
please do so by November 12th. There are bins at each location for your
donations. Thanks!***

***\*The next Strength Program starts Sunday, November 6th. For more
info contact Eric at fallscitystrength\@gmail.com.***
