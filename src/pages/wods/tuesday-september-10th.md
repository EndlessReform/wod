*Make Up Day. \*If you missed a Test Day this is the last chance to make
it up!*

**\*This Friday from 3-? Bluegrass Bodyfat Testing will be set up to do
body fat tests for just \$30 (\$25 for GG competitors)!  This is a
\$15-\$20 savings off their normal prices so take advantage of this
deal!  You will get wet so bring swimwear or workout clothes and a
towel. <http://www.bluegrassbftest.com>**

***\*This Friday's 6pm class will be cancelled so that we can set up for
our Granite Games Throwdown.  Any help with setting up would be greatly
appreciated!***

**\*This Saturday is our Granite Games Fall Throwdown!  Come out and
cheer on the teams competing and check out our Vendors!  First heat
starts at 9:00am.**
