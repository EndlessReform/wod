10:00 EMOM of:

5-Bench Press \@60% 1RM

5-Clapping Pushups

then,

Death by *(increasing by 2 reps each minute)*:

Shoulder Press (75/55)(RX+95/65)

Calorie Row *(you must reset the rower before each round)*

Dips off Bench (legs straight) (RX+ Bar Dips)

***\*This "death by" will alternate movements each minute. So minute
1:00 is 2 shoulder press, minute 2:00 is 2 calorie row, and minute 3:00
is 2 dips. Minute 4:00 is 4 Shoulder Press, minute 5:00 is 4 calorie
row, and minute 6:00 is 4 dips. This continues to increase by 2 reps per
minute. When you fail to get the desired reps on the first movement you
continue on with the other 2 movements. When you fail on the second
movement you continue on with the final movement until failure. Score =
total rounds completed.***
