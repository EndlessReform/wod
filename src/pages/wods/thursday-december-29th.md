***\*The Ville will be closed on New Years Day, Sunday.  We will reopen
Monday for all regularly scheduled classes at both locations!***

so get ready! RX Men, RX Women, scaled, and masters (50+) divisions.  If
you would like to register please email Daniel at:

enter.  Each workout will a daily WOD and you'll be able to do it during

programming.***
