***\*Our annual 12 Days of Christmas wod will be on Christmas Eve this
year.  Classes will be at 10:30 & 12:00 and are free to all!  All other
class times and open gym are cancelled.  We'll have two versions of the
workout, one for beginners, and will have a sign up sheet by the white
board so that each class can get done in an hour.  We'll be closed
Christmas Day and reopen on Thursday for the 10:30 class.***
