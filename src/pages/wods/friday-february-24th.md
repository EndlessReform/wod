**MOVEMENT STANDARDS**

DUMBBELL SNATCHES

The dumbbell snatch starts with the dumbbell on the ground and nishes
with the dumbbell directly overhead. At the bottom of the movement, BOTH
heads of the dumbbell must touch the ground. The dumbbell must be lifted
overhead in one motion. Touch-and-go is permitted. Bouncing the dumbbell
is not allowed. Athletes must alternate arms after each repetition and
may not alternate until a successful rep is achieved. The non-lifting
hand and arm may not be in contact with the body during the repetition.

::: {.column}
At the top, the arms, hips, and knees must be fully locked out with the
dumbbell clearly over the middle of the athlete's body when viewed from
pro le. Once the athlete has reached lockout, the repetition will count.
The athlete may choose to do a split style snatch. However, both feet
must return and be in line under the athlete's body while the dumbbell
is locked out overhead for the repetition to count.

The burpee box jump-over starts with the athlete facing the box while
touching their chest and thighs to the ground, and nishes with the
athlete jumping over the box. In the bottom position, to ensure the
athlete remains perpen- dicular to the box on each rep, the center of
the athlete's chest must be on the line, and the feet and hands must be
straddling the line.

There is no requirement to stand tall while on top of the box. A
two-foot takeo is always required, and only the athlete's feet may touch
the box. The athlete may jump on top of the box using a two-foot landing
and then jump or step o to the other side, or the athlete may jump
completely over the box. If jumping over the box, the feet must go over
the box, not around it, and the athlete must use a two-foot landing.

Each rep is counted when the athlete lands on the ground on the opposite
side, where they may begin their next rep.
