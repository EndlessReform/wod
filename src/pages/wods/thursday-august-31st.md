**\*\*Update as of 3:30pm: Still no water at East but it's supposed to
be on today so we won't cancel the 5:30 class.  If you need running
water head to the Ville for the 4:30 or 5:30 class.   Main Street is
closed at Clay because of the sewer break so you may want to come in
down River Road or Washington Street.**

**\*\*Attention Louisville East 6:00am & 10:00am class attendees!  These
classes will be cancelled tomorrow because there is no water at East.

The Ville's 6:00am or 12:00pm class tomorrow instead.  Thanks.**
