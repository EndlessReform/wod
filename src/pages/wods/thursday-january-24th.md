Rest Day.

#### ***\*The CrossFit Open starts February 21st! To prepare we'll be throwing in some past Open WOD's in our class programming. Register for the Open at: Games.CrossFit.com.***

#### **\*CrossFit the Ville's Barbell Club will start back up this Saturday.  If you'd like to improve your Clean & Jerk and Snatch these classes are for you.** **Classes are an hour and a half each and offered Saturday's (11:15-12:45) and Sunday's (1:45-3:00) each weekend after our CrossFit classes. You can pay per class *(\$15 for members, \$20 for non members)* or pay upfront for a discounted rate for the entire online program plus all classes *(\$120 for members, \$200 for couples)*.  Since we missed one session last Sunday due to the weather we'll take that class off the total if you are paying for the entire program.**
