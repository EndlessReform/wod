Globo gym vs CrossFit gym
-------------------------

<div>

I visited a Crossfit affiliate for the first time ever this weekend.
Allow me to compare and contrast a first-time Crossfit visit vs. a
first-time Globo gym visit. Globo first:

-   Enter gym. Notice front desk employee sitting in front of a
    computer. Wait about 15-20 seconds for them to stop playing
    solitaire or Facebook.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   "Hi, I'm Brian. This is my first time here." "Oh, let me get a
    "trainer" to show you around."

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Walk through the gym. Trainer shows you the "cardio areas", which
    consist of rows upon rows of treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary
    bikes.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Next, you are shown the "machines areas". Various contraptions with
    diagrams that highlight whatever muscle group the thing is supposed
    to isolate. If you're lucky, they'll have Hammer Strength stuff!!
    You may get a line like "This machine is designed to work you
    exactly like free weights." You think to yourself, "Hmmm, well why
    not just do free weights, then?" You also note that at least 2 of
    the four walls in every area are made up entirely of mirrors. And
    people are standing and looking at themselves in them.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The tour continues: "Here we have the free weight area. You can use
    this if you want to get hyoooge." This typically equates to the
    square footage of a walk-in closet. Work boots, little tank-tops,
    and multiple shakers full of
    [supplements](http://rehobothcrossfit.com/nutrition-diet-recipes/supplements/ "supplements")
    abound.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Now, the all-important retreat into a tiny office where you get the
    used-car sale. Something like, "Well, typically our memberships are
    \$59/mo, plus a \$269 sign-up fee. We'll waive the fee and set you
    up on a tiered payment plan where every year the fee will drop
    11.59043% until you reach year 4, at which point..." blah blah blah.
    You counter with, "Well my friend pays \$20/mo with no sign-up fee."
    They respond, "I'll have to get my manager." The dance continues.
    You threaten to walk out. At this point, you may or may not get the
    "super secret pricing deal". You realize you've lost a little bit of
    your soul. They throw in free tanning.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   You are now a member. You work out for 2 years. You see the same
    people every day. You never talk to them. After 2 years you notice
    that they all look exactly the same as the first day you ever saw
    them, despite the fact that they spend at least an hour a day on the
    elliptical while
    [reading](http://rehobothcrossfit.com/library/ "reading") a magazine
    or talking on their cell phones.

**OK, the Crossfit gym first-time experience:**

-   The first thing you notice is that there really isn't a front door
    -- it's a garage door. Or two. Did this place used to be an auto
    shop?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The next thing you notice are people on the floor gasping for air.
    You can see this clearly as the whole place is one open room and the
    garage doors are open.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   You walk in. At first, you're not quite sure who works there and who
    works out there -- they all look about the same. Eventually, a
    trainer or owner finds you and greets you enthusiastically.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   You're invited to take part in a workout. As you wait for the
    current group to finish up, you take notice of your surroundings.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   No air conditioning. No mirrors. Not a single treadmill. Rowers --
    uh oh.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Ropes and gymnastics rings hanging from the ceiling. Kettlebells.
    Weight racks. Weird rubber weights. Lots and lots and lots of places
    to do pull-ups. Instead of mirrors, the walls are covered with
    dry-erase boards. And peoples names are listed under various
    workouts that have girls' names as the titles. Obviously people
    compete over everything here. As people finish the workout and peel
    themselves off the floor, you notice that they all seem to be
    friends.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   OK, time for the workout. A trainer takes you and whoever else is
    there for a first-time visit and you do some stretches, and then
    they actually teach you how to do whatever you're going to be doing
    that day. Real
    [instruction](http://rehobothcrossfit.com/media/videos/health/ "instruction")
    (with PVC pipe), and the guy (or girl) actually sounds like they
    know what they're talking about.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Workout time. 3-2-1-go. 1 minute into the workout you realize that
    you actually might die before it's done. You regret eating whatever
    it was you ate for breakfast, because you're pretty sure everybody
    is going to see it coming out of your mouth. 7 minutes later you're
    finished, and soaked with sweat on a pile on the floor. You think to
    yourself that you did more work in 7 minutes than most people at
    your old globo did in a month.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   After the workout, you're told you can hang around and ask questions
    or go home and ice yourself down. No pitch.

Now, which one sounds better? I'm pretty sure I have not exaggerated
anything here -- these are my actual experiences. I'm also joining the
Crossfit gym.

Taken from CrossFit Rehoboth..So True so very true.

Do you have a story of your experience at a Globo Gym, Please share.
