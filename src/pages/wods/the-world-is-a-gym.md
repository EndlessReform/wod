** Go Outside.**

**If there's one thing I've learned during this trans-national**

**adventure of mine, it's that there is nothing like training out**

**in the open. Urban environment or rural environment, city**

**street or barren trail ... get outside and train without walls.**

**Some might argue that cities, by their very nature, don't**

**lend themselves to physical exploration. They're lazy. Some**

**say the countryside encourages accessibility, freedom of**

**movement and an exploratory eagerness that cities do**

**not. Maybe it's not our environment that cultivates these**

**characteristics in us, but we who find them in it. There are**

**no objects in nature whose equivalent can't be found in a**

**city if you're looking with open eyes. Mountains are nature's**

**staircases, and trees are her climbing walls. Carrying a bag**

**of cement is the same as shouldering a fallen limb, and**

**lifting a stone is, well, you get the picture.**
