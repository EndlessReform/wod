**Our 2nd Annual Pre Open in house competition will start today! RX Men,
RX Women, scaled, and masters (50+) divisions. If you would like to
register please email Daniel at: Daniel\@crossfitlouisvilleeast.com with
which division you'd like to enter. Each workout will be a daily WOD and
you'll be able to do it during class so there's no reason not to enter!
Each workout will also be done only once so unlike the Open it won't
interfere with our regular programming.**
