Rest Day.

**\*Today is the final day of the 2017 CrossFit Games. We are having a
party at the Barnett's house today from 12-6 so please stop by if you
can make it. We'll eat, watch the Games, and swim if you'd like. This is
a family friendly event so bring the kids! Please bring a side dish (if
your last name starts with A-M) or dessert (if your last name starts
with N-Z). We'll supply the meat and drinks. Call or text Daniel for
directions 502-235-4545. Â Sunday's 12:30 class will be cancelled for the
party.\***
