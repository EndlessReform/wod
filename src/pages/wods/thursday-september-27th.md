***\*Join us this Saturday at NuLu Fest just a block up on Market
Street!  NuLe Fest starts at 11:00am so get in class first then head to
NuLu.  There will be live music, stuff for the kids, food etc.***

***\*Next Saturday, October 6th, we will host a nutrition seminar
starting at 11:00am.  This is free for our members but you are welcome
to invite friends.  Non members will only pay \$25.  This should last
about an hour and a half.  This will be the same, individual specific
guidelines Daniel has successfully used with numerous personal training
clients as well as CrossFit members through the years.  There will be no
advocating of crazy fad diets, or of the latest miracle supplement (that
doesnt exist).  Just useful, well established information for
individuals to change their eating habits in order to gain muscle, lose
bodyfat and recover from intense workouts.  All while allowing room for
eating the foods you crave from time to time!***
