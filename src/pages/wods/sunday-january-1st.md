Rest Day. Â The Ville will be closed today. We will reopen Monday for all
regularly scheduled classes at both locations!

so get ready! RX Men, RX Women, scaled, and masters (50+) divisions. If
you would like to register please email Daniel at:
Daniel\@crossfitlouisvilleeast.com with which division you'd like to
enter. Each workout will a daily WOD and you'll be able to do it during
class so there's no reason not to enter! Each workout will also be done
only once so unlike the Open it won't interfere with our regular
programming.**
